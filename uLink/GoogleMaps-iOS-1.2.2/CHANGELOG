Version 1.2.2 - April 2013
==========================
Resolved Issues:
  - Tappable regions for GMSMarker fixed.
  - Overlays are no longer able to render on half pixels.
  - Ground overlays appear underneath the My Location dot.
  - GMSPolyline 'strokeColor' is no longer erronously deallocated.

Version 1.2 - April 2013
========================
Features:
  ! Removed GMS...Options classes in favor of creating overlays directly
    and setting their 'map' property
  ! Map overlays (GMSMarker, GMSPolyline, others) now inherit from a shared
    GMSOverlay class
  ! GMSPolyline now has 'strokeWidth' and 'strokeColor' to match GMSPolygon,
    rather than 'width' and 'stroke'
  ! More helper methods on GMSCoordinateBounds, 'including' renamed to
    'includingCoordinate', added 'includingBounds'
  - Added GMSPolygon and GMSCircle overlays
  - A GMSMarker may be animated when added to a map
  - Overlay types may now be subclassed
  - GMSCameraUpdate to create camera update objects, including operations to
    set a camera that presents a specified GMSCoordinateBounds
  - GMSUISettings may be used to add a compass or My Location button (disabled
    by default)
  - Non-marker overlay types may be tapped (see GMSMapViewDelegate)
  - Default marker changed to the Google Maps for iPhone marker
  - Added markerImageWithColor: to create tinted versions of the default marker
  - GMSMapLayer, the CALayer subclass for GMSMapView, now supports modification
    of its camera properties, allowing for advanced animation effects

Resolved Issues:
  - visibleRegion now reports correctly sized region on Retina devices
  - Double-tap to zoom now centers around tapped point
  - Disabling pan via UISettings now prevents movement with zoom gestures
  - GMSPolyline performance is improved for large polylines
  - GMSMapView may be subclassed
  - My Location dot appears underneath markers
  - Performance improvements when using the My Location dot
  - Grayscale polylines now render correctly
  - Calling renderInContext: on the GMSMapView layer now renders correctly;
    this allows for snapshots and UI effects
  - The default behavior when a marker is tapped has been updated to also pan
    the camera to the marker's position
  - semaphore_wait_trap issue resolved

Version 1.1.2 - March 2013
==========================
Resolved Issues:
  ! Updated the SDK to use libc++ instead of libstdc++
  - Improved support for including a GMSMapView and GLKView in the same app

Version 1.1.1 - March 2013
==========================
Features:
  - Improved the messages that are logged to the console when a invalid key is
    used or a connection error occurs
  - Added multi-line snippet support for GMSMarker

Resolved Issues:
  - GMSMapView could return a nil camera
  - Multiple GMSMapView instances no longer 'camera crosstalk.'
  - The SDK contained unresolved external references
  - A GMSMarker with an empty title and snippet no longer shows an empty
    info window.

Version 1.1.0 - February 2013
=============================
Features:
  ! The points of a GMSPolyline (and GMSPolylineOptions) are now specified as
    a GMSPath and built via a GMSMutablePath, rather than addVertex: etc
  - GMSPolyline may now be specified as geodesic
  - animateToCameraPosition: method on GMSMapView
  - GMSProjection provides containsCoordinate: and visibleRegion helpers

Resolved Issues:
  - GMSCameraPosition and animateToLocation: now clamp/wrap latitude/longitude
    respectively; similarly, bearing is clamped to 0 <= bearing < 360
  - GMSGroundOverlay may be modified after creation
  - The points of a GMSPoyline may be modified after creation
  - GMSPolyline may cross the antimeridian
  - Resolved a marker sorting issue

Version 1.0.2 - January 2013
============================
Features:
  ! GMSCamera (struct) has been dropped in favor of GMSCameraPosition * (objc
    class), supports finer control of bearing and viewing angle
  - Added GMSUISettings to control gesture availability
  - Added GMSGroundOverlay/GMSGroundOverlayOptions for basic ground overlay
    support
  - Removed requirement to call startRendering/stopRendering
  - Support for adding GMSMapView as a custom UIView in Interface Builder
  - Improved texture memory handling

Resolved Issues:
  - Info windows now have highest tap priority
  - Selected markers are automatically brought to front
  - Polylines now render at constant size regardless of the zoom level

Version 1.0.1 - December 2012
=============================
Initial release alongside Google Maps for iOS.
Support for 3D maps, rotation, tilt, 3D buildings, markers, polylines,
satellite and terrain tiles, traffic data, and other features.
